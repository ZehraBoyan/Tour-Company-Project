# Tour-Company-SQL-DDL-and-DML-commands
I created a SQL database using DDL and DML commands in my project named Tour Company.
I organized the customer and tour guides data of a tour company that I created imaginatively with normalization.
I created all the necessary objects as tables with DDL commands.
I added the data with DML commands.
I created the relations between the tables. (1-1.1-N, N-N)
Using the procedure method, I obtained the invoice details and necessary information of the customers who purchased tours from the tour company.
I completed the project with Execute.
I answered 8 questions I created using Queries.
